# Greg Reeve

## Abstract

I have spent four years of PhD research on entity search and natural language processing,
  and have extensive experience with ElasticSearch, Lucene and Spark.
I love building stuff and believe in the power of technology,
  that is why I have spent the last year doing my startup [Hyperlink](https://hyperlinkapp.com).
I speak proficiently in Python, Scala, Javascript and Java,
  and OK in Go, PHP and C++.
Check my previous projects [here](https://chunlianglyu.com/projects/),
  most of them are open source on [GitHub](https://github.com/cllu).
